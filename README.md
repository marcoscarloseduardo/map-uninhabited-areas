# Map density population areas with R
In this repository, you will learn how to use the [Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) population data to map the population density of one or multiple countries, using R and ggplot2. Argentina is used as an example.

This tutorial is based on a guide developed by [Milos Popovic](https://twitter.com/milos_agathon).
